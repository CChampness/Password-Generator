# Password Generator
```
The Password Generator is an application that enables employees to generate random
passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. It runs in the browser and
features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. It has a responsive
user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
```

## Password Types

The user can select any sized password from 8 to 128 characters.  The character types
can include any combination of one or more of the following types:
* Upper cse letters
* Lower cse letters
* Numbers
* Special characters

## User Story

```
From time to time, an employee with access to sensitive data will need to conveniently
generate a new password which is random and strong to meet certain criteria, providing the best possible security.
```

## Features of the Password Generator application

* When the user clicks the button to generate a password, a series of prompts
is presented to collect the desired password criteria

* First, the user is prompted for the length of the password.
* If the chosen length is not at least 8 characters, then the user receives 
an alert saying that the chosen length is too short.

* If the chosen length exceeds 128 characters, then the user receives 
an alert saying that the chosen length is too long.

* Once the chosen length is validated, the user is asked for character types
  to include in the password.
  
* Character types can include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.

* Each answer for every prompt input is validated to ensure that least one character 
  type gets selected.

* When all prompts are answered and validated, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

* When the password is generated, it is displayed in the bordered text area box.
