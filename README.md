# Password Generator
```
The Password Generator is an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. It runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. It has a responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
```

## Password Types

* The user can select any sized password from 8 to 128 characters.
* The character types can include any combination of:
** Upper cse letters
** Lower cse letters
** Numbers
** Special characters
One or more of the above types can be included in the password


## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
